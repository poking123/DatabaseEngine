Selinger's Algorithm

- estimatePredicates
	- go through the string of table names
	- lowercase the table names with a predicate
	- put lowercase name in Catalog
	- return string with lowercase names (if it has a predicate)


- loadInPairs
	- go throuh the string of table names (now lowercased)
	- and put in "bestOrderMap", just itself (best order for 2 tables is just those two tables)
	- aB -> aB and Ba -> Ba


- computeBest
	-
