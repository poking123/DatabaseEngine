Inside all RAOperations, we have a colsToKeep, which will take the rows from the original rows









Optimizer:
	- get map of tableName (char) -> needed columns (int)

	- add a project of a scan instead of just a scan

	- map of columns -> indices

	- use a header to keep track of columns
	- we can get TreeSet from map and then make an array of columns to keep
